# Hi, I’m @Jal-E 👋

- 👀 I’m deeply passionate about **AI/ML**. Currently, I’m working on my thesis around **Viral Cascade Prediction** and exploring how deep learning can enhance **Autonomous Driving** through behavioral learning and road segmentation in my AV lab.

- 🌱 Always learning: whether it’s understanding how autonomous systems make decisions or predicting viral trends online, I’m driven by curiosity and innovation.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to:
  - Real-time data processing for stock tracking or anomaly detection
  - Autonomous vehicle perception, behavioral learning, and camera-based systems
  - Generative AI applications for text-based analysis and filtering
