# Hi, I’m @Jal-E

- I’m deeply passionate about **AI/ML**. Currently, I’m working on my thesis around **Viral Cascade Prediction** and exploring how deep learning can enhance **Autonomous Driving** through behavioral learning and road segmentation in my AV lab.

- Always learning: whether it’s understanding how autonomous systems make decisions or predicting viral trends online, I’m driven by curiosity and innovation.

- I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to:
  - Real-time data processing for stock tracking or anomaly detection
  - Autonomous vehicle perception, behavioral learning, and camera-based systems
  - Generative AI applications for text-based analysis and filtering

- You can reach me via:
  - **LinkedIn**: [Anjali Rai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anjalirai0706/)
  - **Email**: jalraibhardwaj@gmail.com
  - **Website**: https://jal-e.github.io/Portfolio-website

- Fun fact: I've studied for the **UPSC** exam in India, which has given me a unique perspective on problem-solving and self-learning.
